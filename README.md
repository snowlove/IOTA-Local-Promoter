# IOTA Local PoW promoter

* What is this?
	* This will promote/reattach your transactions to speed up confirmation.
* How is this different than Raijvs?
	* This does not require the node you're using to have PoW enabled. IT HAPPENS LOCALLY!


Features:
* Promote Transactions
* Reattach Transactions
* Customizable nodes enter the node you wish to connect with.
* All PoW is done locally on your PC, so you don't have to find a node that has PoW enabled. (uses webgl aka uses your GPU for PoW)
* PoWer!


Credits: Idea from Rajiv Shah, GpanosXP for his local PoW spammer that this uses to promote.
